    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This One Pot Creamy Cajun Chicken Pasta is creamy, smoky and spicy. It's incredibly easy to make, so it’s 
            perfect for weeknight dinners.
        </p>
        <p>
            This pasta is spicy, but you can adjust the heat by adjusting the amount of cayenne pepper in the Cajun seasoning.
            This pasta is also creamy. If you don’t want it as creamy you can adjust the amount you add. However, the 
            creaminess does balance the heat and acidity very well.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp thyme</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 lb chicken</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>0.5 lb penne pasta</li>
            <li>15 oz fire roasted diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl 
                (paprika, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, pepper, salt). Cut the chicken 
                into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over top, 
                and stir to coat the chicken in spices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high 
                until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet 
                and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not 
                need to be cooked through at this point.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to sauté for about 2 minutes more, or just until the 
                onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir just until 
                everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, stirring every couple of 
                minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks, then stir until it has melted into the sauce. Top the pasta with sliced 
                green onions and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
