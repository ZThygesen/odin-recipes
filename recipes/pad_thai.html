    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pad Thai is one of the world’s most beloved noodle dishes. 
            Along with Thai Green Curry and Red Curry, this is the dish by which 
            every Thai restaurant is measured.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pad Thai is a Thai noodle stir fry with a sweet-savoury-sour 
            sauce scattered with crushed peanuts. It’s made with thin, flat 
            rice noodles, and almost always has bean sprouts, garlic chives, 
            scrambled egg, firm tofu and a protein – the most popular being 
            chicken or prawns/shrimp.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place noodles in a large bowl, pour over plenty of boiling water. 
                Soak for 5 minutes, then drain in a colander and quickly rinse under cold water. 
                Don’t leave them sitting around for more than 5 – 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix Sauce in small bowl - tamarind puree, brown sugar, fish sauce and oyster sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan (or well seasoned skillet) over high heat. 
                Add garlic and onion, cook for 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chicken and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until mostly cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Push to one side of the pan, pour egg in on the other side. Scramble using the wooden spoon 
                (add touch of extra oil if pan is too dry), then mix into chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add bean sprouts, tofu, noodles then Sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toss gently for about 1 1/2 minutes until Sauce is absorbed by the noodles.
            </li>
            <li>Add garlic chives/green onions and half the peanuts. Toss through quickly then remove from heat.

            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately, sprinkled with remaining peanuts. Enjoy!
